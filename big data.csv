that such information could be used to discriminate against Americans on issues such as housing and employment even as it makes their lives easier in many ways  Big data  is everywhere It allows mapping apps to ping cellphones anonymously and determine  in real time  what roads are the most congested  But it also can be used to target economically vulnerable people The issue came up during a    day review ordered by President Barack Obama  White House counselor John Podesta said in an interview with The Associate Press  Podesta did not discuss all the findings  but said the potential for discrimination is an issue that warrants a closer look Federal laws have not kept up with the rapid development of technology in a way that would shield people from discrimination The review  expected to be released within the next week  is the Obama administration s first attempt at addressing the vast landscape of challenges  beyond national security and consumer privacy  posed by technological advancements President Barack Obama requested the review in January  when he called for changes to some of the National Security Agency s surveillance programs that amass large amounts of data belonging to Americans and foreigners The technology that enabled those programs also enables others used in the government and the private sector  The White House separately has reviewed the NSA programs and proposed changes to rein in the massive collection of Americans  phone records and emails  It was a moment to step back and say   Does this change our basic framework or our look at the way we re dealing with records and privacy    Podesta said in the interview  With the rapidity of the way technology changes  it s going to be hard to imagine what it s going to look like a generation from now  But at least we can look out over the horizon and say   Here are the trends  What do we anticipate the likely policy issues that it raises   Podesta led the review  along with some of Obama s economic and science advisers  The goal  Podesta said  was to assess whether current laws and policies about privacy are sufficient Podesta would not discuss the specific recommendations he will make to Obama  He did mention an unexpected concern that emerged during White House officials  meetings with business leaders and privacy advocates  and merits further examination  how big data could be used to target consumers and lead to discriminatory practices Civil rights leaders  for example  raised in discussions with the White House the issue of employers who use data to map where job applicants live and then rate them based on that  particularly in low paying service jobs  While big data is revolutionizing commerce and government for the better  it is also supercharging the potential for discrimination   said Wade Henderson  president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights Some employers might worry that if an applicant lives far enough away from a job  he or she may not stay in the position for long  As more jobs move out of the city and into the suburbs  this could create a hiring system based on class  You re essentially being dinged for a job for really arbitrary characteristics   said Chris Calabrese  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union   Use of this data has a real impact on peoples  lives  The civil rights advocates could not offer specific examples of such injustices  but instead talked about how the data could be used in a discriminatory way Federal employment laws don t address this nuanced tactic  Calabrese said  Similarly  anti discrimination laws for housing make it illegal to target customers based on credit reports  But the laws don t address the use of other data points that could group people into clusters based on information gleaned from social media For instance  companies sell data amassed from social media sites that clumps people into clusters  such as the  Ethnic Second City Struggler  category  A bank could target people who posted something on social media about losing a job as a likely candidate for a high interest loan  The idea is that a person who lost a job may be behind on mortgage payments and might be open to a high interest loan to help get out of a bind  Calabrese said  You are individually targeted for a loan based on inclusion on one of these lists and get a high interest rate  That is in spite of the fact that if you walked in off the street you might qualify for a lower rate   You never know that you are being targeted individually since you just click on an ad on the side of a website   Calabrese explained   That is the discrimination  Jennifer Barrett Glasglow  chief privacy officer for data broker Acxiom  said her company in Little Rock  Ark   screens clients before selling them data to help ensure that the data will be used appropriately and not for discriminatory reasons She also said a discriminatory offer can be made without Acxiom data  We ve got to be careful that we don t go after the data itself   she said Glasglow said the  Ethnic Second City Struggler  category can be very effective for reaching communities in need  such as for advertising a sale or an offer that provides more affordable services  Glasglow said consumers can report what they believe to be unfair practices to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Let s go after the people engaged in bad practices   she said The concept of putting people into categories  or  segmenting   for marketing purposes is not new  said Eric Siegel  an expert in predictive analytics  which is the art of determining what to do with data on behaviors ranging from shopping habits to criminal activity Few dispute that there are lots of good reasons to use big data  There s been a push by the administration to say that these are important tools  and the ability to apply analytics to that data is important for a whole range of issues from health care to education to public safety   Podesta said It can help communities be more efficient A New York data analysis operation under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg allowed the city to pinpoint properties with a higher risk of deadly fires by analyzing fire department data in conjunction with data on illegal housing complaints and foreclosures The federal government recently announced an initiative to provide private companies and local governments with better access to climate data  This data could help communities and developers decide where not to build based on predictions about sea levels Political campaigns  particularly the      presidential campaign  rely on large data sets to target specific donors who might be able to deliver the most cash  Those kinds of analyses led to a multibillion dollar haul in contributions  the most expensive White House run in history Nuala O Connor  president of the Center for Democracy and Technology  said there needs to be more transparency in how companies are using this data  and that means updating some laws One is the Electronic Communications and Privacy Act of       Podesta said he will recommend an update to that law  which governs how the government can access private communications for law enforcement purposes  This is something privacy advocates and some members of Congress have long sought  There are certainly gaps in the law   O Connor said  speaking broadly   The technology is outpacing regulatory and legislative change     Associated Press writer Jack Gillum contributed to this report    ","LONDON   Britain s newly formed competition regulator plans to use  big data  to identify industries where traditional players are stifling competition from online rivals  the regulator s chairman said on Tuesday In a speech at the European Consumer Summit meeting in Brussels on Tuesday  David Currie  chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority  announced a new research project to identify sectors where incumbent companies use their advantage to block the emergence of online business models and competition  This will use  big data  techniques to identify sectors of the economy where online commerce is developing more slowly than might be expected  so it can investigate whether this is because incumbents have acted anticompetitively to block entry or innovation by online competitors or innovators   according to the prepared text of Mr  Currie s speech The new watchdog was created by the combination of Britain s Competition Commission with certain consumer functions of the Office of Fair Trading  It officially began operation on Tuesday ","A COUPLE of deals are shining a spotlight on just how big of a deal big data is becoming on Madison Avenue The deals  both for undisclosed financial terms  are to be announced on Monday  They involve companies that specialize in the collection  interpretation and predictive analysis of information about the behavior and habits of consumers  particularly the Americans ages    to    who are known as the millennial generation In one transaction  the Intelligence Group  a division of the Creative Artists Agency  the talent agency in Los Angeles  is being combined with a company  Noise  that also specializes in the young adult market  In the other  a unit devoted to research into millennials at Barkley  an agency in Kansas City  Mo   is being spun off as a separate consultancy  named FutureCast    With the arrival of big data     the ZenithOptimedia agency writes in a new report about United States advertising  marketers have    a wealth of data points with which to target    consumers  But the sheer bigness of big data can also represent a challenge  Mark Grether  global chief operating officer of Xaxis  a media and technology company owned by WPP  described last week a need to    extract more meaning more quickly from the massive amounts of anonymous big data being generated on a moment by moment basis    Noise is part of the Engine USA division of the Engine Group  an agency holding company based in London  The deal is the first acquisition by the Engine Group since December       when it bought Noise    I   m a great believer in focus  specific targets and specific demographics     said John Bernbach  president of Engine USA  and many marketers these days will    do whatever it takes to reach    the millennial audience The Intelligence Group     founded in      as Youth Intelligence and acquired by Creative Artists Agency in          is known for studies about younger consumers that it publishes under the name Cassandra Report  The Intelligence Group has offices in Los Angeles and New York  the Los Angeles office will become the Los Angeles office of Noise and the New York office will be absorbed by the New York headquarters of Noise   Noise also has an office in San Francisco  Two senior executives of the Intelligence Group  Joseph Kessler and Jamie Gutfreund  will take top posts at Noise  Mr  Kessler  who had been president of the Intelligence Group  becomes president and chief executive of the combined Noise  and Ms  Gutfreund  who had been chief strategy officer of the Intelligence Group  becomes chief marketing officer of Noise   Noah Kerner  who had been chief executive of Noise before the deal  will take the post of nonexecutive chairman     We   re at this moment in time     Ms  Gutfreund said  when    understanding who the millennials are and why they do what they do    will help advertisers reach a market that accounts for an estimated      trillion in annual spending  The Intelligence Group has worked for brands that include Disney  Honda  Microsoft  Red Bull and Unilever The sale of the Intelligence Group by Creative Artists Agency represents its second recent deal involving its marketing interests  coming after the company sold back to SS K  a New York advertising agency  a minority stake in SS K that it acquired in      At Barkley  the goal of the youth focused unit  started in       has been to help marketers contend with    a tsunami of data     said Jeff Fromm  the executive vice president of Barkley who is becoming president of FutureCast One trend the data indicates  according to Mr  Fromm  is that to win among millennials     marketers have to do more than beat other brands  they have to become a favorite    And that extends beyond the millennial generation  he added  to Americans in their   s and   s    who are adopting the millennial mind set    Barkley has handled millennial focused work for brands like Ball Canning  Coleman and the Missouri Lottery  As FutureCast starts  its initial client roster includes Foster Farms and Whole Foods Market  Mr  Fromm will own a minority stake in FutureCast and Barkley will hold a majority stake    Jeff was part of the group at Barkley that came up with the idea to have a specific focus on millennials     said Jeff King  chief executive of Barkley     He did an amazing job running with the ball       We initially set out to make ourselves experts in millennials for two reasons  to help existing clients and to develop content of interest to potential clients     Mr  King said     The demand for that expertise has far exceeded our wildest expectations    By establishing FutureCast as a stand alone company  it will be able to work with marketers that are not Barkley clients  he added  as well as other advertising agencies What will be the next big thing after it becomes common to use big data to help determine how to market to millennials     Today         women over the age of    are going to have a baby     Mr  Fromm said     and again tomorrow    Those babies  along with children who are younger than millennials  compose a demographic group that Mr  Fromm calls    Generation Next  or the Plurals     for reflecting their multiculturalism  Other terms used to describe that cohort are post millennials and the pluralist generation ","Thomas Edison would be proud  General Electric  the company he started  still knows how to make a buck off cutting edge technology In this case  the technology is in the so called Internet of Things  in which sensors feed data to central repositories  which can analyze and manage enormous amounts of data from the machines  Initial uses include more efficient maintenance  remote monitoring  asset tracking and spotting new patterns of behavior that might be profitably exploited Work on the IoT has been a priority of G E  s chief executive  Jeff Immelt  for more than  three years  On Thursday  the company announced that revenue from its IoT software business will be      billion this year  probably the fastest a G E  business has hit the    billion mark The company did it entirely with sensor equipped G E  machines  including     million pieces of medical equipment and        jet engines  All in  the company said  each day it now gathers    million pieces of data from    million sensors  off equipment worth    trillion Next year  G E  plans to connect this big data product  called Predix  to machines made by other companies  It is also establishing a means for companies to build and deploy their own customized software applications on Predix  Part of that approach involves using G E  s own modeling software  which helps a customer understand ahead of time whether making the software is justified by anticipated cost savings If successful  the GE analysis platform will likely touch tens of millions of devices around the globe  Already  Cisco has agreed to put Predix software inside its networking products  starting with a specialized computer router for harsh environments like oil fields  Intel has developed a reference architecture that integrates Intel processors with the GE software  Softbank  Verizon and Vodaphone have agreed to provide means of wireless connectivity to devices with the software  GE already has a deal like that with AT T  which means the system could be used across much of the globe  In a release announcing the deals  Mr  Immelt said that  Our offerings will increase G E  s services margins and boost organic industrial growth  with the potential to drive as much as     billion in annual savings across our industries    The world cannot go on managing in a large scale fashion using old technology practices   said Bill Ruh  vice president of G E  software   This enables people to put more intelligence in their machines  and do real time control of their equipment  Much remains to be seen  including what G E  plans to charge for its software and services  and whether customers are comfortable moving their data through a G E platform  While GE already has    so called  predictivity  offerings  for areas like energy  transportation  aviation and healthcare  Mr  Ruh said that G E  sees offering its platform to others  as a way to go into other industries  Presumably he meant the sale of software to these  but that prospect could also make some businesses uncomfortable  This is the latest in a series of steps by G E  to be a force in what it terms The Industrial Internet  In June  G E  and others announced a global standards body to speed the deployment of sensor laden machines Mr  Ruh said the product offering also included new kinds of online security  so potential weaknesses could be remotely patched across a large system  This kind of global application management and updating has become increasingly important  as more businesses adapt to a world of remote devices connected to powerful data centers Mr  Ruh also said Predix currently touches        G E  locomotives         G E  wind turbines        gas turbines and        pieces of oil and gas equipment  His software division  located near Silicon Valley  now includes       people  and will add another     people by the end of the year  Attrition in       he said  was     percent  an unusually low number in a hot

patterns found in the payments it processes  a top executive told Reuters MasterCard  which handles payments for   billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants  uses that information to generate real time data on consumer trends  available more quickly that regular government statistics  It is an incredibly fast growing area for us   Ann Cairns  who heads MasterCard s business outside North America  said in an interview  stressing that the company respects cardholder privacy  using anonymous data rather than personal information MasterCard does not give figures for its information services products but  other revenues   which include the sale of data  grew    percent in the first quarter of      to      million  outpacing the growth of total revenue dominated by payments processing  which rose    percent to        billion Cairns said clients for the data include retailers  banks and governments  with MasterCard tailoring it to their needs  Retailers are fantastic at using the data they have available about how people shop in their store  how their inventory turns over  but what they don t know is what happens outside their store   she said   The data we ve got is ubiquitous across the whole market  We can help retailers see what they need to do to capture more sales  Cairns      a statistician by training who joined MasterCard in      after helping manage the disposal of Lehman Brothers assets in Europe  revels in the insights real time card data can provide  such as London s popularity as the world s top travel destination and a rise in spending on experiences such as eating out or going on holiday rather than shopping in stores MasterCard has recorded a spike in spending in Brazil on groceries and a drop in spending on luxury goods as the price of food has risen ahead of the World Cup  she said  the kind of insight valued by companies such as Nike and Adidas that are hoping to sell      soccer boots during the competition GROWTH IN E COMMERCE  EMERGING MARKETSWhile MasterCard expands in  big data   Cairns sees no slowdown in its traditional business of processing payments  with plenty of potential for growth as    percent of consumer transactions are still made by cash or cheque  Moving money and doing it safely and securely is so deeply cared about by so many people around the world that it will be a business that has fantastic value now and for years to come   said Cairns  who previously worked at Citigroup and ABN Amro London based Cairns  whose division accounts for    percent of MasterCard s business  said the expansion of e commerce and emerging markets is driving growth  noting that     billion people are still without access to financial services She predicted that shoppers in many developing economies will leapfrog plastic cards and go direct to payment via smartphone   adding MasterCard is providing  digital wallet  technology to retailers and banks and does not see their own moves into the payments field as a competitive threat She also played down the challenge from other new rivals such as Kenya s money transfer service M Pesa  owned by Safaricom  and eBay s online payments unit PayPal  which is trying to move into physical transactions  We run at such a sub infrastructure level around the world  It is very difficult to replicate our network   she said  adding that M Pesa had built a branch network to receive and make payments in Kenya  but that would not work in countries where there is more established financial infrastructure  Most counties in the world have ATM networks and point of sale networks  Because they are so ubiquitous  that model won t fly   she said Meanwhile  MasterCard is entrenching its technology in other emerging markets  for example developing a biometrics based card used for benefits payments in South Africa and working with the Nigeria government on a pilot to overlay payment technology on a new national identity card  Reporting by Emma Thomasson  editing by Louise Heavens "," CAMBRIDGE  Mass    With the success of its free open online course system  called MITx  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology finds itself sitting on a wealth of student data that researchers might use to compare the efficacy of virtual teaching methods  and perhaps advance the field of Web based instruction Since its inception several years ago  for instance  MITx has attracted more than         unique registered users from about     countries  university officials said  Those users have generated     million interactions with the school s learning system and have contributed around         forum entries  many of them quite personal As researchers contemplate mining the students  details  however  the university is grappling with ethical issues raised by the collection and analysis of these huge data sets  known familiarly as Big Data  said L  Rafael Reif  the president of M I T  For instance  he said  serious privacy breaches could hypothetically occur if someone were to correlate the personal forum postings of online students with institutional records that the university had de identified for research purposes  How do we set the boundaries  and balance the competing interests   Dr  Reif asked in a public talk on Monday morning   If you believe in the potential of digital learning  you have to care about the larger question  How can we harness this flood of data to generate positive change   without destroying the very idea of privacy  Parallel questions hover over our work in field after field  As the opening speaker at a workshop titled Big Data Privacy  sponsored by M I T  and the White House  Dr  Reif framed some of the big questions that have arisen from the increasing public and private sector use of powerful large scale data mining techniques While proponents view such big data analytics as promising tools for discovering useful insights in medicine  education  marketing and many other fields  consumer advocates warn that without explicit federal rules or policies overseeing their use  computer generated algorithms could potentially be used to identify people who would prefer to remain anonymous  or to discriminate unfairly  They could be used  for example  to offer some consumers perks while others are charged higher prices or interest rates  With that in mind  President Obama in January started a federal review intended to examine the impact of big data technologies and whether they might pose new kinds of privacy intrusions into how people live and work  The workshop at M I T  is the first in a series of academic events  sponsored in part by the White House  intended to explore the technologies involved in big data and the privacy problems they may pose  along with potential policy and technological solutions One goal of the project  said John Podesta  the counselor to the president who is leading the Big Data Privacy review  is to determine how the public and private sectors might maximize the flow of information necessary for innovation while minimizing the potential privacy risks to individuals  What the president wants to explore  in part  is whether our existing privacy framework can accommodate these changes  or if there are new avenues for policy that we need to consider   Mr  Podesta said in a speech for the M I T  event  delivered by phone because snow conditions in Washington prevented him from attending in person  Have we fully considered the myriad ways in which this data revolution might create social value   he added   and have we fully contemplated the risks that it might pose to our conceptions of individual privacy  personal freedom and government responsibility of data   ","For years  the concept of  big data  has promised companies all manner of insights about their businesses  Now  one Silicon Valley start up is trying to make that data easier to use The start up  Adatao  announced on Thursday that it had raised a     million financing round led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz to help bring its product to market  Though the product has been in development for a couple of years  Adatao first spoke publicly about it in December  and the company is in the early stages of signing up business customers Andreessen Horowitz and the other investors in the round  which include Lightspeed Venture Partners and Bloomberg Beta  are betting that companies will embrace Adatao s subscription based software  The software  which aims to combine analytical rigor with intuitive design  lets companies search for patterns in the troves of data they collect in their regular course of business Christopher T  Nguyen  the chief executive and co founder of Adatao  said he had already signed up customers in telecommunications and finance  though he declined to identify them  He also declined to disclose the company s valuation in the financing round or its revenue  Mr  Nguyen  who received a Ph D  from Stanford in electrical engineering  helped start a computer driven trading firm before joining Google in       working as an engineering director in its apps division  Google is an expert at mining data  but Mr  Nguyen said he wanted to create a way for other companies to have access to similarly powerful tools In connection to the financing round  Peter Levine  a partner at Andreessen Horowitz  is joining Adatao s board ","On  Mad Men  this spring  the plot hinged on whether the creative types like Don Draper could adjust to the newfangled device in the office   a gigantic computer  I know what this company should look like   Jim Cutler  a partner elbowing for control of the ad agency  said in one episode   Computer services  Media buys pinpointed with surgical accuracy  It s the agency of the future  That line could just as likely have been spoken today as in      Computers are once again transforming the business of marketing  infusing the art with science  This time  though  the change is being driven by cloud computing and the processing of huge amounts of data about what customers do and what they desire Unlike the computer on  Mad Men   which took up an entire room  the computers processing the data are not even in marketers  offices but in far off data centers  But just as in the fictional company depicted on  Mad Men   the new technology is causing tensions among the quants  or quantitative data analysts  the artists and the information technologists  The profile of a chief marketing officer used to be someone who wore a black turtleneck and worked at Nike  but now increasingly it s someone who studied math and worked at a hedge fund and then got very involved in data driven marketing   said Glenn Kelman  chief executive of Redfin  the online real estate brokerage firm   Now the phrase I hear is   We need a Moneyball marketer    For consumers  the result is personalized marketing When Redfin customers visit the website or mobile app  they see homes that might appeal to them  based on the ones they have looked at or lingered on  If they do not like tile countertops  and if they can go to open houses only in the morning before the baby naps  Redfin learns that  too  We don t want to be annoying and call them at dinner  which is what marketing used to do   Mr  Kelman said   We want to send them just the right email or show up in their Facebook feed at just the right time with just the right house  You can call that an advertisement or you can call that a service  Consumers now expect Delta Air Lines to know if they are a frequent business flier out of San Jose with a preference for window seats  and Sephora to know that they buy products for the skin but not those for nails or hair Ideally  consumers do not notice the computing and data crunching in the background and instead just see more relevant messages from brands  said Ian Schafer  chief executive and founder of Deep Focus  a digital agency  But when marketing is too personalized  it can feel creepy  Consumers are asking a lot of questions  like  Why is that Zappos ad following me around the Internet     said Fatemeh Khatibloo  a senior analyst who studies marketing and big data at Forrester Research   It s a huge gray zone that marketers are legitimately scared of  They need to be really conscious of   Just because we can do it  should we    Behind the scenes  the data analysis is handled by a wide array of cloud services companies  The companies collect data  compare it with data from the past  and determine how to use it and how the final product the consumer will see should look  They include Adobe  BloomReach  Axiom  Epsilon  BlueKai  IBM  Oracle  Salesforce and Teradata  Because a lot of these things now are hosted in the cloud  marketers can make changes and really control that experience and what they show to the consumer in real time   said John Mellor  vice president for business development and strategy for the Adobe Marketing Cloud  whose clients include Audi  Disney and Dell The astonishingly fast consumer shift to mobile devices has made these tools even more necessary  Mr  Schafer said  My Armageddon theory about the whole thing is  as people move away from the desktop environment into mobile devices  traditional banner ads don t work  and what are brands going to do if the way they ve been advertising digitally for the last decade stops working   he said   We re facing that head on right now  and better data and better use of that data will be critical for advertisers making that leap from a desktop advertising world to a mobile one  The new kind of marketing is a technological challenge that also has major business consequences  said Peter Lee  who oversees Microsoft Research   Small changes in the behavior of these systems make gigantic revenue differences   he said But for employees who are used to the old marketing methods  the shift has sometimes been difficult  One area of conflict has been between marketing departments and I T  departments  which once controlled the technology employees used but no longer always do  It creates a ton of tension because marketing iterates and is very experimental  and I T  wants stability and security   said Joelle Kaufman  director of marketing and partnerships at BloomReach  a cloud marketing company Another concern among some marketers is that technology is threatening the heart and soul of their work   creativity  intuition and art  It s a fundamental issue of trust because  to be frank  the tech side thinks the creatives are wandering around with their heads in the clouds  and the creative side is scared of the nerds   said Cindy Gallop  who started the United States branch of Bartle Bogle Hegarty  the ad agency  The key is to use the data to inform the art  said Ms  Gallop  who is no longer with the agency  That is why there is barely a distinction between the marketing and analytics departments at Redfin  Mr  Kelman said  There is a bit of an overemphasis on big data sometimes   Ms  Khatibloo said   What we don t want to have happen is to use this very scientific tool and make creative directors go away  Data has given precision and a lot more science to these fields  but I don t think we should do away with intuition entirely  Sometimes  data driven marketers learn more about customers than even the people closest to them A Redfin customer recently started receiving personalized listings for homes in San Diego   even though he had been looking at real estate in Chicago  where he lived  It turned out that unbeknown to him  his wife was tired of Midwest winters and had been browsing homes in California  Eventually  they bought a house in San Diego ","  Google Flu Trends  once a poster child for the power of big data analysis  seems to be under attack This month  in a Science magazine article  four quantitatively adept social scientists reported that Google s flu tracking service not only wildly overestimated the number of flu cases in the United States in the         flu season   a well known miss   but has also consistently overshot in the last few years  Google Flu Trends  estimate for the         flu season was more than    percent higher than the cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And  they wrote  for a period of more than two years ending in September       the Google estimates were high in     out of     weeks The article   The Parable of Google Flu  Traps in Big Data Analysis   declared that Google was guilty of  big data hubris   which the authors defined as the implicit assumption that big data sets trump traditional data collection and analysis  And they were skeptical of Google Flu Trends  algorithmic smarts   The comparative value of the algorithm as a stand alone flu monitor is questionable   they wrote A follow up analysis by the four authors tracked Google Flu Trends  performance in the just concluded         flu season  after Google updated its algorithm last October  There was some improvement  but the service still overshot by about    percent  the authors wrote  in their paper  posted online The authors  analysis found that simply using the recent trend of C D C  reports from doctors on influenza like illness  which lag by two weeks  would have been a more accurate predictor than Google Flu Trends The authors might appear to be unlikely critics of a tool like Google Flu Trends   We re fans of big data and the use of data science   said Alessandro Vespignani  a professor at Northeastern University  David Lazer is a professor at Northeastern  and Ryan Kennedy  an assistant professor at the University of Houston  has a yearlong research fellowship in computational social science at Northeastern  They have affiliate links with Harvard University s Institute for Quantitative Social Science  whose director  Gary King  is the fourth author Their technical criticism of Google Flu Trends is that it is not using a broader array of data analysis tools  Indeed  their analysis shows that combining Google Flu Trends with C D C  data  and applying a few tweaking techniques  works best   The mash up is the way to go   Mr  Lazer said Matt Mohebbi  co inventor of Google Flu Trends  agrees  Much of the current criticism  in his view  misses the point that the service was always intended as a  complementary signal  rather than a stand alone forecasting tool  I think we were consistent in the way we communicated that from the outset   Mr  Mohebbi said  He left Google in      and is a co founder of Iodine  a start up that will use data science for a consumer health service  to provide personalized advice on medications Yet respected authors and academics often pointed to Google Flu Trends as proof of the triumph of the big data approach  Tracking    flu related search terms over billions of searches  monitoring trends and making correlations would win out  Google could tap the  collective intelligence  of society in real time  free of the human bias and hypotheses of traditional methods The authors of the recent articles were partly motivated by the desire to puncture that notion   Google Flu Trends became this paradigm that you just look at all this data  make correlations  and we don t need anything else   Mr  Vespignani said Google Flu Trends was introduced in the fall of       having started long before as a Google    percent project begun by Mr  Mohebbi and Jeremy Ginsberg  In an article in Nature in       the two were among the co authors who explained Google Flu Trends   This system   they wrote   is not designed to be a replacement for traditional surveillance networks or supplant the need for laboratory based diagnoses and surveillance  What it could do  they wrote  is give an early warning signal of flu outbreaks one to two weeks ahead of the C D C  surveillance reports  In the      Nature paper  they showed that it had given that advance indication in the         flu season   and that it would again during the      H N  outbreak  It gives you that near real time signal   Mr  Mohebbi said   and it has proven that it does add value   We re only at the beginning of what s possible with this big data style analysis   he added   And big data and small data are both very important  In a statement  a representative for Google Flu Trends  which now monitors    countries  said the service was reviewed every year  with improvements in mind   We welcome feedback on how we can refine Flu Trends to help estimate flu levels and complement existing surveillance systems  The two recent papers by the computational social scientists are part analysis and part commentary  Mr  King said one of the issues raised is the data reversal that has occurred in science   It used to be that academics has way more data than companies   he said   But that has flipped now  In the paper  the authors wrote of the need for researchers to be able nonetheless to study the  evolution of sociotechnical systems    and the work of data driven algorithms of private companies with far reaching influence  That includes a field like public health and the proprietary software engine beneath Google Flu Trends  The algorithms underlying Google  Twitter and Facebook   they wrote   help determine what we find out about our health
