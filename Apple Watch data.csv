"Watching Timothy D  Cook last week as he introduced the Apple Watch to the world was almost touching  in his channeling of his predecessor  The back and forth pacing of the stage  the hand gestures  the cadence of his speech and the script unabashedly filled with superlatives    We set out to build the best watch in the world    were all reminiscent of the late Steven P  Jobs Of course  Mr  Cook lacks the track record  life story and the showman s flair of the Apple co founder  But while leaders all leave the stage sooner or later  corporate values can endure  For decades  Apple has stood out in the business world for three things  taste  trust and utility  These are not words scribbled on a white board or printed in an annual report  but values that have guided Apple s product and design decisions  The Apple Watch reflects and interprets those values   how well it has done that will be its test of success or failure Taste was a touchstone for Mr  Jobs  It was a term he used often  To him  taste was a value and a journey  acquired through curiosity  learning and life experience  Seek out the best that your culture has to offer  he would say  and your work will be enriched with taste  whether you are a software programmer or a sculptor Years ago  in his Palo Alto home  Mr  Jobs pointed to the wooden chairs in his living room  made by George Nakashima  a Japanese American woodworker  Mr  Jobs explained that Nakashima had a cross cultural blend of experience  studying architecture  traveling on a free spirited tour of the world  and working in different cultures  Nakashima s designs were original  Mr  Jobs said  because he had a distinctive sense of taste  shaped by his life experience The pursuit of taste was a value Mr  Jobs instilled in the Apple corporate culture  including a  The Best Things  course in the company s internal training program  the so called Apple University People possess taste  but products are designed and built by teams of such people  Jonathan Ive  who was made senior vice president for industrial design in       shortly after Mr  Jobs returned to Apple  is the field marshal of the company s corps of designers  And under Mr  Cook  Apple has recruited top talent in design and fashion from companies including Burberry  Nike and Yves Saint Laurent  Tim Cook has done an excellent job of retaining and recruiting critical people   said David B  Yoffie  a professor at Harvard Business School How well does the Apple Watch do on the taste test  The consensus is that it is a stylish piece of personal technology  given all that s in it  The critique among outside designers is that Apple has crammed too much in it  The watch  according to a former Apple designer  had its origin with a tiny iPod Nano Touch  introduced in       People attached a strap to the minuscule media player  and wore it on their wrist  listening to music while jogging The iPod heritage  however  gave way to a more iPhone style concept   And it s very hard to make big things small   said the former Apple designer  who asked not to be named because he still has business contacts with the company   This feels more like it was designed by committee  The Apple alumnus also said the relatively short battery life of the watch   company executives said they expected users to recharge daily   suggests the industrial design team has the upper hand over the hardware designers these days  Recharging a watch daily  he said  is a hardware side compromise  In the past  the hardware group often prevailed in such trade off decisions  For example  he said  the industrial designers wanted to have wireless headphones on the iPod  But that would have sapped power  requiring more frequent recharges  so that idea was shelved  he observed Another former Apple designer  Paul Mercer  agreed that the Apple Watch is chock full of digital offerings   They went very wide in terms of the feature set   he said But Mr  Mercer added that the  system experience   like turning the watch s crown to zoom in and out on the screen  and to scroll through lists  was innovative and  very fluid   Mr  Mercer  a software designer  said   It has the hallmarks of a classic Apple product  On the trust front  the Apple Watch should benefit from a trailing wind of good will  People like Apple products  to say the least  Its offerings have a well earned reputation for feeling intuitive and personalized  Apple products respect the individual  People trust Apple  They often give the company the benefit of the doubt that when there is a slip up  such the recent incident when some risque celebrity photos were hacked from iCloud  things will be fixed and quickly The Apple Watch  among other things  is a powerful health monitoring device  which will harvest troves of personal data  if users so choose  That raises privacy concerns  and the matter of trust in a different context for Apple  In addressing that worry  Mr  Cook observed that Apple has a different business model from companies whose financial lifeblood is advertising  like Google and Facebook  If the product is free  as they say  you are the product  Not so for Apple  It owes its vast sales and immense corporate wealth to products people can hold in their hands  and that customers pay dearly for But health data is particularly private  and how it is used will depend not only on Apple but on outside software developers who make health apps that run on Apple devices  The company s recently revised guidelines for health apps say developers cannot use the data for marketing purposes and that data cannot be shared with third parties without a user s consent  But how closely will Apple police outside developers  when more developers making more apps means more reasons for people to buy Apple products  I think Apple is certainly aware of the privacy issues with health data   said Marc Rotenberg  executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center   But whether it really enforces those guidelines to uphold its privacy commitments will be the real test  The value of utility  in the Apple context  has meant redefining whole product categories and how people use them  That has been the story of the media player  iPod   smartphone  iPhone  and tablet  iPad  The utility questions surrounding the Apple Watch come in a few dimensions  Will it feel too much like an iPhone on your wrist  Here  Apple is endangered by its past success  The communications and notification features on the Apple Watch look neat  So now people will be walking around staring at their wrists instead of their smartphones  Is that a big addition to utility Then  there is a question of how many people will find utility from the device  Will the health monitoring features  when combined with other offerings on the Apple Watch  for example  be enough to make large numbers of consumers buy it  Much of that audience  presumably  is already wearing a fitness wristband like Fitbit or Jawbone And is Apple limiting the market for the Apple Watch with its strategy  Under the current plan  the Apple Watch works only with iPhones  But about    percent of smartphones worldwide run Google s Android operating system  according to IDC There is a precedent here  The iPod took off as a hit product after Apple shifted course and decided to make it sync with computers running Microsoft s Windows as well as Apple computers  The Apple Watch  said Michael A  Cusumano  a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Sloan School of Management  will  only be as big in share as iPhone allows it to be  A missed opportunity  I think  Mr  Cusumano and Mr  Yoffie are co authors of a book to be published next spring   Strategy Rules  Five Timeless Lessons from Bill Gates  Andy Grove  and Steve Jobs   based on their study of the three tech industry pioneers and the challenges of their successors  Their conclusion  Mr  Yoffie said  is that the successors were successful as stewards in maintaining and sometimes enlarging the existing businesses   But they struggled to deliver the same kind of revolutionary change  as their predecessors  Mr  Yoffie said   Apple Watch appears to fit that model  We ll see  It s worth remembering that the iPod  iPhone and iPad  in turn  were greeted with initial skepticism  Apple Watch seeks to be the next in that lineage  routing the skeptics and delivering a massive payoff for Apple  How much of the Apple magic remains is uncertain  Like others  Mr  Mercer  the former Apple software designer  has questions about the Apple Watch and its fate  The answers that matter most will begin to come next year  when the Apple Watch goes on sale   I can t wait to get mine   Mr  Mercer said ","Good morning

subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will supply screens for Apple Inc s smartwatches  The Electronic Times reported on Monday The report  which cited unidentified industry sources  said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light emitting diode  OLED  screens for the Apple watches that go on sale in April Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early       the South Korean newspaper said LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report  Apple could not be immediately reached for comment Apple has scheduled a special event on March    where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch  The watch  which will let consumers check their email  pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information  represents Apple s first major new product introduction since the      launch of the iPad  Reporting by Se Young Lee  Editing by Edwina Gibbs ","LAS VEGAS      Apple   s forthcoming smartwatch poses a conundrum for advertisers  How to tap the enticing possibilities of the tiny gadget without overwhelming consumers with messages At this week s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  mobile marketing firm TapSense plans to release an Apple Watch ad buying service  The service will provide a first glimpse of how businesses can serve up ads on the watch  even though the gadget will not be available until later this year At issue  the same qualities that render the watch exciting to Madison Avenue  such as the ability to detect customers approaching a store and to zap an ad directly to their wrists  also risk alienating those customers Apple declined to comment on the use of its watch by advertisers  and will not attend CES officially  But many companies that make devices and services based around Apple products will be there  including several that are working with WatchKit  a software development tool Apple released in November that allows developers to build watch tailored applications Using that tool  developers are devising Apple Watch ad formats including interactive wallpapers on the watch dial with brand logos and personalized clock faces  said TapSense s chief executive Ash Kumar  His product helps developers insert ads  bought and sold instantaneously  in those apps The watch   s main screen allows the display of several tiny icons  including for email  weather  time  and potentially a few favorite service and retail apps Businesses could use those apps to notify customers of special deals  but only within already opened apps  Kumar said  Otherwise  the vendor risks annoying consumers by introducing an ad that is out of sync with whatever they are doing If a consumer is using a transit app on the watch to monitor delays  for example  an advertiser could insert a marketing offer that would light up on the watch face for a ride sharing service or a deal at a coffee shop nearby  Kumar said SMARTWATCH SPAM BOX But moderation is key  Push notifications and banner ads on smartphones can be turn offs  Some marketers advise avoiding showing ads to users who typically click out of them or delivering the same ad too many times to any one user  If it feels like your smartwatch is turning into a spam box  you will take it off   said Padden Guy Murphy  who heads business development and public policy at car sharing service Getaround The startup is exploring using Apple Watch s location based features to target new customers  Apple has not added global positioning on the Apple Watch  but apps can track location as the device is tethered to a smartphone If a consumer shows interest in an ad  such as raising the wrist for a better look  WatchKit allows for notifications that expand and take up more room on the screen  Conversely  a disinterested consumer could tap an  X  mark to exit the ad  TapSense s Kumar said Communicating through buzzing or vibrations is currently only available on Apple s own apps on its wearable device                                       FORCE PUSH          Whether Apple scores a hit with its upcoming Apple Watch and creates a new mass market category remains unclear  Venture capitalist Fred Wilson caused a stir last week by predicting the watch    will not be the home run product that iPod  iPhone  and iPad have been    But advertisers see potential  They particularly like a watch feature that Apple calls  Force Push  that activates when a user taps the screen with extra pressure  opening up a menu with up to four actions  They envision coupons that when tapped can show directions to a store  for example         Ad executives hope that the watch can overcome challenges that have prevented location based ads from succeeding on mobile phones  Unlike on phones  says Jeff Malmad  North American mobile director at media agency Mindshare  users will not need to dig into a bag or pocket to see the ad  They will be right on a user   s wrist  in sight at all times           But to keep them effective  he says  consumers will need to opt for them  much as many consumers opt to receive email messages from various retailers  Additional reporting by Christina Farr  Editing by Sarah McBride and Tomasz Janowski ","CUPERTINO  Calif       As computerized wristwatches go  the upcoming Apple Watch looks impressive I like that it will come in two sizes  so the watch won t feel giant on smaller hands  as some competing watches do I also like that Apple will offer a variety of straps and materials  so fitness buffs can get a strap that s stronger and sweat proof  while those seeking a fashion accessory can opt for an    karat gold edition Beyond looks  it s great that the Apple Watch isn t simply adopting the smartphone way of doing things  The operating system  Watch OS  was designed specifically for the watch  and its interface relies heavily on the dial to the right  known as the digital crown  Competing watches tend to emphasize the voice and touch controls found on phones Of course  it s premature to conclude that you need an Apple Watch  I had only about    minutes with the Apple Watch and other new products announced Tuesday  The watch I was allowed to try on was running in a demonstration mode  It ll take more time with the watch     beyond a controlled environment     to make a solid conclusion What I m seeing so far  however  points to another winner for Apple The home screen has all your apps  arranged in rows like a honeycomb  You use the dial to zoom in and choose one  The touch screen lets you slide the honeycomb around to see different portions of your app collection  I find this easier than swiping on a small screen to scroll through pages and pages of apps  With the Apple Watch  you can even rearrange apps so that your favorite ones are toward the middle App developers will be able to decide what types of notifications appear on the watch and let you take actions such as replying to messages  That s an improvement over existing smartwatches  which largely replicate the notifications sent to your phone  To be compelling  the watch shouldn t duplicate your phone  It should enhance it  Apple seems to get it As for using the dial to zoom in and out  Apple says that improves usability because you re not blocking maps and other content on the screen the way pinching in and out would  That makes sense  though I ll need more time with the watch to assess how well the dial works on its own  With your home screen  for instance  you still need to slide apps around Another question mark is what kinds of apps will be available for it Apple announced a few useful ones  including the ability to unlock your Starwood hotel room with a tap of your watch  That s easier than pulling out your room key from your wallet  BMW also promises one to help you find your parked car in a crowded lot  If it works  that beats walking around in circles Apple does have a good track record in getting software developers to make good apps for its systems  Many apps come to iPhones and iPads first  and some have bonus features unavailable on Android  If that trend continues with the Apple Watch  I have no doubt customers will find more useful things to do with it than the smartwatches already out Apple Watch will require an iPhone   or later and will have a starting price tag of       higher than rival watches  Expect to pay even more for the    karat gold edition and other premium models  You ll also have to wait until early next year  as Apple won t have Apple Watch available in time for the holidays As for products and services that will be available sooner     IPHONE   and IPHONE   PLUSApple s new     inch iPhone   and     inch iPhone   Plus are both larger than the current   inch models  They neutralize a key advantage Android phones have had  size And Apple managed to make its new phones thinner  with edges that are curved and fit nicely in the hands  Gone is the glass back  reducing the chances of breakage  The back will now be made of aluminum and feel more like an iPad To improve one handed use  both new models will have a feature called reachability  With two light taps of the home screen button  the icons  controls and content on the top half of the screen snap to the bottom  so you can reach them with the same hand  Once you make your selection  everything snaps back to the top The iPhone   Plus also has new horizontal layouts to take advantage of the larger size Of course  apps have long worked either horizontally and vertically  On the Plus  horizontal viewing extends to the home screen  and apps will be able to arrange content in two columns When texting  for instance  contacts appear on the left and messages appear on the right  On smaller phones  including the regular iPhone    you get one or the other  not both side by side It s a small touch  but it shows that larger doesn t necessarily mean making everything bigger  Windows phones also make use of larger screens by squeezing in more content  but with Android phones  text and images just get blown up     MOBILE PAYMENTSFew people use their phones to pay for goods and services at retail stores  That s because it s not difficult to pull out a plastic credit card  however insecure that technology might be  Apple is trying to change that with Apple Pay  which will come to the new iPhones in October and the upcoming Apple Watch when it s out Apple improves over existing systems in a few ways     Apple already has your credit card information from iTunes  so setting Apple Pay up with your first credit card is easy  To add additional cards  you can either enter the details or snap a photo In my brief tests  the phone grabbed my credit card numbers correctly  though I sometimes had to enter my name and expiration date myself because of poor lighting conditions  But grabbing those numbers is a good start  as I m prone to make typos with    digit numbers otherwise     Apple uses the phone s fingerprint identification system to authorize purchases  Other wallet apps require passcodes  which can make mobile payments take longer than simply pulling out your credit card     Apple stores card information on a secure chip on your device  not on its servers  And it s not even your real card number  Rather  Apple verifies your card information with your bank and then stores an alternative card number That way  if a merchant s system gets hacked  only the alternative number is compromised  and that number would require one time security codes available only with the physical possession of your phone     The system works with credit cards issued by a variety of banks  including all three of mine  A payment system called Softcard  formerly known as ISIS  doesn t support any of my three banks  Amazon s Fire phone has a wallet app  too  but it doesn t even do credit cards  which is surprising for a retailer  It

Apple Inc s newly unveiled smartwatch on Tuesday split fashion arbiters who may prove pivotal to its broad acceptance Many praised the  Apple Watch   priced from      when it debuts next year  for its clean aesthetic  but some bloggers and editors said the watch had a masculine aura  which would limit its allure to parts of the style conscious crowd  Others said the design  while pleasing  was less than revolutionary The gadget  which must be paired with an iPhone  is shaped like a traditional timepiece  with a small square display  A dial on the side  reminiscent of the winding mechanism on a mechanical watch  can be spun or pushed to manipulate what is on the touch screen Apple will offer three different versions    sport  standard  and a luxury edition  with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated  The display can be customized to show the time in numbers or a facsimile of a watch with hands Wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue  The Watch recognizes voice commands and carries sensors that can track activity such as steps and heart rate Roseanne Morrison  fashion director for The Doneger Group  an industry consultant  said the design fell short of her expectations  It s not pretty   she told Reuters   It s very future techno as opposed to feminine sexy  Many contacted by Reuters agreed that the device

billion to      billion in      Eric Wilson  fashion news director for InStyle Magazine   said Apple also faces competition from luxury watch makers like Rolex  Swatch has said it s exploring a watch with intelligent digital features  The Apple Watch will be a status symbol to carry   he said  But the design is  generic in the sense of its flexibility and individualization   With the exception of the bright colors and gold trim  he added  it is  a very masculine watch  Some fashionistas may prove reluctant to wear a smartwatch at all  said Sonny Vu  chief executive of Misfit Wearables  which makes an activity monitor that can be worn as a broach  on a necklace  or on a wrist band  Some female consumers are concerned about tan lines  for instance  and many might own a watch that has sentimental value  he said But other fashion critics were effusive  It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design  The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly  essentially an amazing gadget   said Alexandra Shulman  editor of British Vogue VIEW FROM FASHIONWEEKThe Watch is the closest the U S  company has come to selling a fashion accessory and marks its first foray into the personal luxury goods market  although its iPhones and other gadgets have long been seen as fashion symbols Wearable technology was the  topic of the moment  at New York Fashion
